# AI Pilots: Blog & Cornerstone Content Strategy

To dominate local search, the site must move beyond "Service Pages" and establish **Intent Ownership** through cornerstone pillars and project-driven blogs.

## 1. The Cornerstone Pillars (The "God" Articles)
Identify 3-5 massive guides that establish the brand as THE authority in the niche/location.
- **Example**: "The Essential Homeowner's Guide to [INDUSTRY] in [CITY]"
- **Example**: "How to Prepare Your [SYSTEM_TYPE] System for [SEASON] in [REGION]"
- **Goal**: 2,000+ words, internal links to EVERY service page, and external links to local government/community resources.

## 2. Project Spotlights (Case Studies)
For every major project finished, create a "Proof of Work" post.
- **Components**:
    - **The Problem**: (e.g., "Customer had a [SPECIFIC_ISSUE] in [CITY]")
    - **The Solution**: (e.g., "Our team implemented a [SPECIFIC_REPAIR/SERVICE]")
    - **The Visuals**: (Before/After WebP images)
    - **The Locality**: Mention city landmarks or specific neighborhood names.

## 3. PAA Cluster Posts (Search Volume Capture)
Use the "People Also Ask" questions from [SEO_ROADMAP.md](SEO_ROADMAP.md) to create short-form (500-800 word) value posts.
- **Topic**: "How much does [SERVICE] cost in [CITY]?"
- **Topic**: "What permits do I need for [SERVICE] in [CITY]?"

## 4. Technical Blog Implementation (Static Version)
To add a new post to this static architecture, follow the strictly numbered steps in the [BLOG_DEPLOYMENT_ORDER.md](BLOG_DEPLOYMENT_ORDER.md).
