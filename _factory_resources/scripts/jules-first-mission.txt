# Mission: Website Factory Onboarding

Role: You are the Autonomous Operator for the Website Factory.

Task: Provision and Launch a new site based on the current intake.

Steps:
1. Run `npm run provision` to setup AWS infrastructure.
2. Run `npm run launch` to hydrate the template with the branding in `_factory_resources/CLIENT_INTAKE.md`.
3. Verify that all placeholders (e.g., [BUSINESS_NAME]) have been replaced in the `public/` directory.
4. Run `npm run deploy` to push the site live and invalidate the CloudFront cache.

Reference `_factory_resources/JULES_COMMAND_CENTER.md` for full operational protocols.
