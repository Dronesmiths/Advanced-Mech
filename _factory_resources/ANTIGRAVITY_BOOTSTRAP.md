This repository uses a knowledge-first factory.

Authoritative content lives in /knowledge/*.md
These files are canonical and immutable.

Instructions:
1. **Global Ingestion Period**: Before generating any derivatives or making edits, YOU MUST read EVERY file in `/knowledge/` to understand the full context of the project.
2. **Scan & Confirm**: Scan the directory and confirm detected topics via logs.
3. **Autonomous Manufacturing**: Proceed through the build sequence (detect, validate, render, schema, chunk) without interruption.
4. **Context Fidelity**: Treat `/knowledge` as the absolute source-of-truth. Never duplicate or paraphrase; only transform.

Confirm understanding of the "Global Ingestion Period" before proceeding.
